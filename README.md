1) Import this data set in SQL work banch
2) Write the SQL query to answer the following question: 

Questions I've solved: 
1. What proportion of our staff are leaving?
2. What is the average age of the employees in each department?
3. Which education field has the highest attrition rate for the employees with less than 5 years of 
work experience and monthly salary between 2000 and 4000 USD.
4. What is the average salary hike for the employees with work experience between 8 years to 10 
years
5. Divided the whole data into two groups – Group1: people with monthly salary more than the 
average salary of all employees and people with monthly salary less than the average salary of 
all employees. For each group analysis the attrition rate in each Job Role. Find the Job role which 
has the highest attrition rate gap across the group.
